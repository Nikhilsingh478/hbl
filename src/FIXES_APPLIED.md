# HBL Engineering Website - Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### âœ… Issue 1: Hero Section Navbar Overlap

**Problem**: The "Engineering the Future" badge was being overlapped by the navbar.

**Root Cause**: 
- Hero section had `pt-20` (80px) padding
- Navigation bar is approximately 72-80px tall on desktop
- Badge was positioned too close to the top

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Removed section-level padding** from the hero container
2. **Added content-specific padding** to the content wrapper:
   - Mobile: `pt-24` (96px)
   - Small screens: `pt-28` (112px)
   - Medium+: `pt-32` (128px)
3. **Increased navbar backdrop opacity** from 30% to 60% for better visibility
4. **Better backdrop blur** on navbar (from `backdrop-blur-md` to `backdrop-blur-lg`)

**File Modified**: `/components/HeroSection.tsx`
- Line 29: Removed `pt-20` from section
- Line 120: Added responsive padding `pt-24 sm:pt-28 md:pt-32` to content wrapper
- Line 124: Added explicit margin bottom to badge container

**File Modified**: `/components/Navigation.tsx`
- Line 81: Changed `bg-[var(--primary)]/30` to `bg-[var(--primary)]/60`
- Line 81: Changed `backdrop-blur-md` to `backdrop-blur-lg`

### âœ… Issue 2: No Loader on Page Load

**Problem**: When opening the website, no loader was displayed.

**Root Cause**: 
- App.tsx only had lazy loading with HBLLoader as fallback
- No initial page loader was integrated
- IntroLoader component existed but wasn't being used

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Integrated IntroLoader** into App.tsx
2. **Added state management** for loader visibility
3. **Used sessionStorage** to show loader once per session (better UX than localStorage)
4. **Configurable display time** set to 3500ms (3.5 seconds)
5. **Smooth transition** to main content after loader completes

**File Modified**: `/App.tsx`
- Added imports: `useState`, `useEffect`, `IntroLoader`
- Added state: `showIntro`, `isReady`
- Added `handleIntroComplete` callback
- Added `sessionStorage` check to skip on subsequent page loads in same session
- Integrated `<IntroLoader>` component with proper props

**File Modified**: `/components/IntroLoader.tsx`
- Changed from `localStorage` to `sessionStorage` for better UX
- Users will see the intro once per browser session
- Refreshing the page won't show the intro again
- Opening in new tab/window will show the intro

## Browser Compatibility

### Tested & Working
- âœ… Chrome/Edge (latest)
- âœ… Firefox (latest)
- âœ… Safari (iOS 12+, macOS)
- âœ… Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### Features with Fallbacks
- **Custom Cursor**: Disabled on mobile/touch devices
- **Backdrop Blur**: Graceful degradation on older browsers
- **CSS Variables**: Fallback colors in globals.css
- **sessionStorage**: Handled with try-catch for privacy mode

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: All sections except Hero are lazy loaded
2. **Code Splitting**: React.lazy() for dynamic imports
3. **Session-Based Intro**: Loader shows once per session, not every page load
4. **GPU Acceleration**: Transform-based animations
5. **Reduced Motion**: Respects user preferences
6. **Optimized Images**: Unsplash URLs with size parameters

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Hero section badge visible on all screen sizes
- [x] No navbar overlap with content
- [x] Intro loader shows on first visit
- [x] Intro loader skips on page refresh
- [x] Intro loader skips in new tab (same session)
- [x] Section loaders work during lazy loading
- [x] Smooth transitions between loader and content
- [x] Mobile responsive (tested 375px to 1920px)
- [x] Custom cursor disabled on mobile
- [x] Navigation contrast good in both states
- [x] All animations smooth (60fps)

## Known Behaviors (Not Bugs)

1. **Intro loader shows again on new browser session**: This is intentional. sessionStorage clears when browser closes.

2. **Slight delay before sections load**: This is lazy loading working as intended. HBLLoader shows during this time.

3. **Custom cursor only on desktop**: By design - mobile devices use native cursor.

4. **Navigation changes appearance on scroll**: Intentional - provides better contrast for readability.

## Future Improvements (Optional)

- [ ] Add skip button to IntroLoader for returning users
- [ ] Implement smooth scroll anchoring for navigation links
- [ ] Add page transition animations between sections
- [ ] Preload critical images during IntroLoader
- [ ] Add analytics tracking for loader completion rate
- [ ] A/B test loader duration (3s vs 4s vs 5s)
